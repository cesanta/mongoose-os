  # Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
  # Uncomment and modify according to your needs.
  # These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
  # from the C code this way:
  #
  # printf("Hello, %s!\n", get_cfg()->my_firmware.message);
  #
  # Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
  #
  # To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
  # build/sys_config.c or build/sys_config.h file.

  # ["my_firmware", "o", {"title": "My firmware settings"}],
  # ["my_firmware.limit1", "i", 123, {title: "Integer setting example"}],
  # ["my_firmware.allow", "b", true, {title: "Boolean setting example"}],
  # ["my_firmware.message", "s", "boo!", {"title": "String setting example"}],

  # Also, you can override an existing "system" value:
  # ["uart.baud_rate", 9600],
