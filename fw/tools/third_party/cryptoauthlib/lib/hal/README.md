hal directory - Purpose
===========================
This directory contains all the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) files used to adapt the 
upper levels of atca-ng and abstractions to physical hardware.

HAL contains physical implementations for I2C, SWI, SPI, UART and timers for specific
hardware platforms.

Include just those HAL files you require based on platform type.
